Project: Corner Grocer App

-What did you do particularly well?
In this project I developed an item-tracking program for a client to track the number of groceries that were purchased throughout the day and use that information to display a certain output depending on the option the user selected. In this project I can highlight that I did particularly well with the declaration and definition of functions, as well as the implementation of header files.

-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Thanks to what I learned about pointers, I was able to apply that concept when declaring the inventory time object. Using pointers made my code more efficient with its memory usage. Additionally, the functions in the InventoryItems object helped the program have a high level of encapsulation and abstraction.

-Which pieces of the code did you find the most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
I had certain challenges when implementing the map-type containers because although I understood them theoretically, I did not know how to ensure that the records of purchased items were saved in the map. However, I was able to resolve this issue by consulting the learning materials in my course, and when creating the code that the map would use, I saw some tutorials on YouTube.

-What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Mainly, I have a better knowledge of object-oriented programming languages, and one of the tools I will use more frequently from now on will be Microsoft Visual Studio Community since I found that IDE to be quite comfortable and relatively easy to use, in addition to that I had no problems installing it and using it on my different computers. I have also added certain websites to my support network such as the Google style guide and the C++ guides from cplusplus.com as they provide many useful tutorials on various aspects of that programming language.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Without a doubt, all the skills and knowledge that I apply can be transferable to other projects that require object-oriented programming, for example, the use of objects, functions, pointers, containers, loops, and documentation are essential elements for any programmer.

-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I created most of the program's functionality within the object called InventoryItems which reduced the code in the Main() file, and these functions can easily be modified and implemented in other projects.
